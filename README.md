52 Pickup
===
Except it's a CLI game written in golang in about 30-60 minutes.

### Why
why not?

### How do I play?
You type `pickup Face of Suit` 52 times for each card.

you don't need to put in the `pickup` but if you want the "real" experience that's how.
Capitalization doesn't matter, Numbered cards are written out e.g. Eight instead of 8.

When finished it will tell you how quickly you did it :)
